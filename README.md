# ScriptRef
Assignment for CS 246 Software Design and Development

INSTRUCTIONS
Your assignment is to create an Android app with two different Activities (pages).

The first page should have three text boxes on it, one for a book, one for a chapter, and one for a verse. Each of these boxes should be labeled. This activity should then have a button labeled "Share" which causes the app to move to the second activity, passing the information from the text boxes.

The second activity should receive the book, chapter, and verse from the first one and display the text, "Your favorite scripture is: D&C 123:17", assuming D&C 123:17 is the book, chapter, and verse from the first activity.
